This is a implementation of a simple distributed file system.  
It contains three modules: master, chunk_node and client.  
It is not very complete and on working.  

# Usage
It uses some third party libraries as submodules, so you need to use 
```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
to fetch these libraries
